1. All projects in IBVC organization are open source, including video and web source. We do not suggest forking our project, but we hope you can join IBVC organization, become one of us, and join us to include video and develop website!
2. IBVC is a global organization for the collection of banned videos. There must be a reason why you can't watch these videos in some places, and there may be some uncomfortable content.We will also add relevant warnings at the beginning of the film, if you ignore the warning and watch our video and there are adverse consequences, we will not be responsible!
3. All videos within IBVC organization are submitted by users. Our internal management group is only responsible for reviewing videos and writing web pages, and the video content has nothing to do with IBVC. We don't make videos, we just move videos. All video copyright belongs to the original author!
